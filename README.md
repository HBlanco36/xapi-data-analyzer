# xapi-data-analyzer
This package was originally created by Walt Boettge and Harrison White, working under Dr. John Moore at the University 
of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Chemistry.

It was created with the goal of parsing and analyzing xAPI data created from H5P elements embedded within the CHEM 109 
Pressbooks online textbook. The program relies on the data being present as an exported .csv file from the UW-Madison 
Learning Locker, and cleaned with DoIT's cleaning script.


## Installation
### For developers: 
Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory.

Next, run `pip install -e .`. This installs an "editable" version of the package that makes development easier by 
creating a .egg-info folder in the project directory, rather than installing the package system-wide. This allows you 
to test changes without having to reinstall every time.

Since the program is never installed system-wide, to remove it simply delete the .egg-info folder in the project directory.

### For users:
**NOTE:** we are planning to use PyInstaller to create a .exe of this and distribute to end users, rather than have users
install it from pip.

Make sure you have the latest version of Python 3 and pip installed.

Then, install the package using pip by running `pip install xapi-data-analyzer` __(once we publish it to PyPI).__

To uninstall, run `pip uninstall xapi-data-analyzer`.

### Input data
#### Data format
You will be prompted to enter the path to the .csv file containing the data. __This data must be in a very specific 
format__ -- that is, the format generated by the cleaning script written by the DoIT Learning Locker administrator, as seen below:
|Name|Verb|Question/Slide|object name?|Response|Correct Answer|Answer Bank|Raw Score|Max Score|Scaled Score (out of 1)|Duration|Date|Time|
|:---:|:--:|:------------:|:----:|:------:|:------------:|:---------:|:-------:|:-------:|:---------------------:|:------:|:--:|:--:|

### What's saved
The program will save two spreadsheets to the directory it was executed in: `xAPI-Data-Analyzer_$TIMESTAMP.csv`, which
contains the stats on the user's selected H5P elements, and `StudentDurations_$TIMESTAMP.csv`, which contains each
student's duration for all of the entered H5P elements.

The timestamp is generated based on Central Time (US).
