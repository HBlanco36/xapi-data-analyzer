# xapi-data-analyzer
This program was originally created by Walt Boettge and Harrison White, working under Dr. John Moore at the University 
of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Chemistry.

It was created with the goal of parsing and analyzing xAPI data created from H5P elements embedded within the CHEM 109 
Pressbooks online textbook. The program relies on the data being present as an exported .csv file from the UW-Madison 
Learning Locker (in the "raw" format).


## Installation
### For users:
Simply download the latest `xAPI Data Analyzer.exe` file and double-click it to launch the program. 

You may get a popup from Windows on your first launch warning about a potential security risk -- this is because the 
.exe is not signed by a registered Microsoft developer. Always exercise caution when running any unknown executables, 
but if you trust the source of the executable, proceed to run it.

### For developers: 
Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory.

To use the program, simply run `xapi_data_analyzer/Main.py`. The program depends on the following libraries, which must be installed for it to run:

* `pandas`
* `pysimplegui`
* `matplotlib`

To create an executable, install PyInstaller (`pip install pyinstaller`) and run the following command in the same 
directory as `Main.py`:

`pyinstaller -wF Main.py`

This will create a standalone executable file (for whatever operating system you run the command on) of the program -- 
no need for the end user to have Python or any of the third-party libraries installed!


## Usage
#### Data format
You will be prompted to enter the path to the .csv file containing the data. __This data must be in a very specific 
format__ -- that is, the format generated by the cleaning script written by the DoIT Learning Locker administrator, as seen below:
|Name|Verb|Question/Slide|object name?|Response|Correct Answer|Answer Bank|Raw Score|Max Score|Scaled Score (out of 1)|Duration|Date|Time|
|:---:|:--:|:------------:|:----:|:------:|:------------:|:---------:|:-------:|:-------:|:---------------------:|:------:|:--:|:--:|

### What's saved
The program will save two spreadsheets to the directory it was executed in: `xAPI-Data-Analyzer_$TIMESTAMP.csv`, which
contains the stats on the user's selected H5P elements, and `StudentDurations_$TIMESTAMP.csv`, which contains each
student's duration for all of the entered H5P elements.

The timestamp is generated based on Central Time (US).
