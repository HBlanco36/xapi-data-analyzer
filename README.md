# xapi-data-analyzer
This package was originally created by Walt Boettge and Harrison White, working under Dr. John Moore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Chemistry.

It was created with the goal of parsing and analyzing xAPI data created from H5P elements embedded within the CHEM 109 online textbook. The program relies on the data being present as an exported .csv file from the UW-Madison Learning Locker, and cleaned with DoIT's cleaning script.

## Installation
Hopefully it's as easy as running `pip install -e .` in the project root directory

Also list some uninstall instructions

## Usage
Run (in a certain directory?) `package-name-here` (with some arguments?).

The program will prompt you to enter (whatever it prompts you to do).
